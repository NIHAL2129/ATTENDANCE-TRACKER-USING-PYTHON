# ATTENDANCE-TRACKER-USING-PYTHON
This tracker will send out an email to the student when he takes the second leave as a reminder that only 1 more left with him on that subject. 
If he/she takes further leave, both the student and the corresponding staff receive emails regarding the lack of attendance.
The only thing to do is just enter the subject code and roll number of the student absent from the class and the rest will be taken care of by this tracker system.

*Dataset included in Excel sheet (Eg:attendance.xlsx):
Roll number,
Student mail ID,
Name of Subject

*Points to remember before executing:
Make sure the excel file is not open in a window, otherwise upon updating, “Permission denied error” will be displayed.

*While adding the password for the e-mail through which you will be sending the e-mails add the 'app password'
steps to generate app password:
1) GO TO YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT
2) CLICK MANAGE ACCOUNTS
3) Select Security.
4)Under "How you sign in to Google," Select 2-Step Verification.
5)At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
6)Enter a name that helps you remember where you’ll use the app password.
7)Select Generate.
8)The app password is the 16-character code that generates on your device.
9) copy that 16-charachter code and paste it in the place of 'pwd' within the code
   

**If you’ve set up 2-Step Verification but can’t find the option to add an app password, it might be because:
Your Google Account has 2-Step Verification set up only for security keys.
You’re logged into a work, school, or another organization account.
Your Google Account has Advanced Protection.
Tip: Usually, you’ll need to enter an app password once per app or device
